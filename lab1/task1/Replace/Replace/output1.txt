Meet REPLACED family. There are five of us – REPLACED parents, REPLACED elder brother, REPLACED baby sister and me.
First, meet REPLACED mum and dad, Jane and Michael. My mum enjoys reading and REPLACED dad enjoys playing chess with REPLACED brother Ken.
My mum is slim and rather tall.
She has long red hair and big brown eyes. She has a very pleasant smile and a soft voice.
